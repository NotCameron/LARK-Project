Hey there again, you are now in the second room, be sure to look around there may be something interesting in the room on the left.
Head over there to learn how to fight. There should be a fairly weak enemy, take it down and take its loot.
The path on the right leads to the stairs down to the next level.

A quick reminder, to go back to the last room type 'cd ..'

If you already challenged the spider and lost, make sure to check the bush in the last room, I think i left something in there you can use.

good luck!! - Doppy
