Hey there again, this is the last skill I can teach you...

There may be some encrypted mana barriers, around the dungeon,
Now these are a little different from the last barriers we encountered because these...
MAKE NO SENSE!!
so to make them make sense we have to use the skill "hex", to use it you do "xxd -p -r *nameofbarrier*"
This barrier has something good so be sure to try!
Hurry down here - Doppy
