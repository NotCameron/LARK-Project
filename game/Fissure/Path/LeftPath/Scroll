Hey they bud, its me Doppy!

There seems to be a monster in this room, fortunately for some reason the monsters of this dungeon dont attack unless provoked, however i have a feeling that there is something dangerous at the bottom of this place.
It would be a good idea to fight all of the monsters in here to get as much loot as possible to prepare for the lower levels. They seem to have a habit of stealing things left behind, including notes from previous adventurers.
To fight the monster in the room type "fight *monstername*" then combat will begin.

I believe in you :) - Doppy
