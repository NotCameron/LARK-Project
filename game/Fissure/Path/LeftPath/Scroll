Hey they bud, its me Doppy!

There seems to be a monster in this room, fortunately for some reason the monsters of this dungeon dont attack unless provoked, however i have a feeling that there is something dangerous at the bottom of this place.
It would be a good idea to fight all of the monsters in here to get as much loot as possible to prepare for the lower levels.
To fight the monster in the room type "./fight" then combat will begin.

I believe in you :)
