Hey friend!

Seems there's a magic mirror here. It needs to see two things that are identical in all but name in order to release it's contents hidden within it's pocket dimension. 
Luckily I know a spell that I call "cp" that lets you duplicate something into another one!

Just type "cp source copy" and it'll copy the source's properties but the name will have to be different!

Then you can "magicmirror source" which should give you the item!
