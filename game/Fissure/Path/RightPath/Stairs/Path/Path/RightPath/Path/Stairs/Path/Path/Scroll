This chest here seems to be locked. I have left some lockpicks for you. I have never been too good at lockpicking myself but you can give it a shot! To lockpick type "tar -xzf lockedthing". I will even leave a lock if you want to lock something yourself. Just type tar -dzf to lock something. I do not think there is much use in locking things around here though.
