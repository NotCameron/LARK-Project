Good job making it down here,

After defeating that monster you should be ready explore, but this dungeon can get pretty confusing. It's hard to tell where I've been sometimes. 

Dont be afraid to think outside the box.
It gets fairly busy down here so you may not see many more of my Scrolls...
But dont worry, im still somewhere down here so just look for me
Good luck friend - Doppy :)
