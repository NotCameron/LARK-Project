Why'd you hop into the bush?

Well whatever good job doing it anyways, i left a sword behind the bush just incase my weapon broke.
Since i havent come back for it yet why dont you have it.

Best of luck to you my friend... I hope we can meet along your journey - Doppy

It seems like all there is here is some webbing, the sword isn't even here
