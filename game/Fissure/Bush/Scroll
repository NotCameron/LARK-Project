Why'd you hop into the bush?

Well whatever good job doing it anyways, i left a sword behind the bush just incase my weapon broke.
Since i havent come back for it yet why dont you have it.
To equip items type "equip *itemname*".
By the way, to go to the last place you were in use "cd .."

Best of luck to you my friend... I hope we can meet along your journey - Doppy
