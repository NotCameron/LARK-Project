echo "The First Floor:

*You feel a piercing glare from all around you, but the feeling vanishes as fast as it appeared*

It is calm, and there dont seem to be any monsters nearby...
The only thing is this room is a Bush.
Hmm choose one of the paths to explore, but have your wits about you there are dangers around every corner. "
