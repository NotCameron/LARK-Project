Hello to whoever sees this,

My name is Doppy and im an adventurer like you, but im most likely much deeper in the dungeon by now...
I'm leaving behind a trail of these scrolls just to give some advice and any helpful tips to those who seek the dungeons glory so be sure to read any  that you may come across.

By reading this scroll i have given you the ability "observe" the room itself more cloesly to use it type "./.observe.sh" and you will be analyse the environment around you. With that you can begin your descent into the dugeon of karL...

Oh and also when choosing the path to follow, instead of typing the entire name out you can type the first few letters and press the 'TAB' key to fill in the rest. Good luck!
