Why'd you hop into the bush?

Well whatever good job doing it anyways, I left a sword behind the bush just incase my weapon broke.
Since I haven't come back for it yet why dont you have it.
To add an item to your inventory use the command "additem *itemname*"
Items can only be added from inside of chests, so you will have to use 'cd chest'
To check your inventory type "inventory"
To go back into the previous area/room type 'cd ..'

Best of luck to you my friend... I hope we can meet along your journey - Doppy
